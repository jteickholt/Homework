Descripton of the PyCity School Data

There are severable observable trends that are seen in the data.  The include:

1.  The small and medium sized schools have a significantly higher Overall Passing Rate than the large schools.

2.  The Charter schools have a significantly higher Overall Passing Rate than the District schools.  
From list of the highest performing schools and the lowest performing schools, there is clearly an overlap between
the school size and the school type, with Charter schools being smaller and District schools being larger. So it is
hard to say here whether the higher passing rate is due to smaller schools or to the school type.  Likely, it is a
combination of the two.

3.  Another trend that is shown is that the overall passing rate tends to be higher in schools that spend less 
per student.  This is counterintuitive.  Genarally, you would think that schools that spend more per
student would have higher passing rates than schools that spent less.  We should further investigate the District 
schools to see if they are overpaying their administrators and wasting money traveling to school administrator 
conferences in Hawaii.
