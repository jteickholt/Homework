# Homework
Contains homework for the Python Challenge and the Pandas Challenge.  I had misunderstood the directions in setting up repos for homework.
For some reason, I thought we were supposed to create a Homework repo and then have a folder for each week's assignment.  I had already created this structure when I realized I should have created separate repos, so I left it as is.  For future homework assignments, I will be creating separate repos.
